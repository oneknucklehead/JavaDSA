##What is Selection Sort:
-> In this, we find out the maximum element in the array and place it in its correct position. In simple terms, we are going to catch hold of an element and place it at its correct sorted position.[Something like this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_j00ImyE0OisydQXo2klYUO3-58i8R6l/view?usp=sharing) As simple as that!
-> Time Complexity:  Worst Case - O(N^2)
		    Best Case - O(N^2)
-> It is not a stable sorting algorithm.
-> This algorithm performs well on small lists/arrays
